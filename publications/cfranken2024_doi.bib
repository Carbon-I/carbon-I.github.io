abstract = {Estimating methane (CH4) emission rates using quantitative CH4 retrievals from the Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) requires the use of wind speeds. Model wind speeds have limited temporal and spatial resolution, meteorological station wind data are of variable quality and are often not available near observed plumes, and the use of ultrasonic anemometers co-located with methane sources is impractical for AVIRIS-NG flight campaigns with daily coverage of thousands of square kilometers. Given these limitations, this study focused on the use of the Twin Otter Doppler Wind Lidar (TODWL) to measure near surface winds and provide coincident measurements to CH4 plumes observed with AVIRIS-NG. In a controlled release experiment, TODWL observed wind speed and direction agreed well with ultrasonic anemometer measurements and CH4 emission rates derived from TODWL observations were more accurate than those using the ultrasonic anemometer or model winds during periods of stable winds. During periods exhibiting rapid shifts in wind speed and direction, estimating emission rates proved more challenging irrespective of the use of model, ultrasonic anemometer, or TODWL wind data. Overall, TODWL was able to provide reasonably accurate wind measurements and emission rate estimates despite the variable wind conditions and excessive flight level turbulence which impacted near surface measurement density. TODWL observed winds were also used to constrain CH4 emissions at a refinery, landfill, wastewater facility, and dairy digester. At these sites, TODWL wind measurements agreed well with wind observations from nearby meteorological stations, and when combined with quantitative CH4 plume imagery, yielded emission rate estimates that were similar to those obtained using model winds. This study demonstrates the utility of combining TODWL and AVIRIS-NG CH4 measurements and emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating both instruments on a single aircraft for future deployments.}

abstract = {Understanding, prioritizing, and mitigating methane (CH4) emissions requires quantifying CH4 budgets from facility scales to regional scales with the ability to differentiate between source sectors. We deployed a tiered observing system for multiple basins in the United States (San Joaquin Valley, Uinta, Denver-Julesburg, Permian, Marcellus). We quantify strong point source emissions (\&gt;10 kg CH4 h−1) using airborne imaging spectrometers, attribute them to sectors, and assess their intermittency with multiple revisits. We compare these point source emissions to total basin CH4 fluxes derived from inversion of Sentinel-5p satellite CH4 observations. Across basins, point sources make up on average 40\% of the regional flux. We sampled some basins several times across multiple months and years and find a distinct bimodal structure to emission timescales: the total point source budget is split nearly in half by short-lasting and long-lasting emission events. With the increasing airborne and satellite observing capabilities planned for the near future, tiered observing systems will more fully quantify and attribute CH4 emissions from facility to regional scales, which is needed to effectively and efficiently reduce methane emissions.}}
