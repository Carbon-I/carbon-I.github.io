Andrew Thorpe is a technologist in the JPL imaging spectroscopy group with a decade of experience working with imaging spectrometer data. He has developed quantitative gas retrievals for AVIRIS, AVIRIS-NG, and EMIT using differential optical absorption spectroscopy, methods to estimate emission rates, and contributed to projects aimed at visualizing methane results and reducing data latency. Andrew is currently an EMIT Science Team member leading the EMIT greenhouse gas mapping application, and the Deputy Instrument Scientist for Carbon Plume Mapper.
