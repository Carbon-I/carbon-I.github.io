Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have been achieved in retrieving GHG data from space-based platforms. Lessons learned from the past play a crucial role in shaping our requirements and approach. We now know that a) very high spectral resolution (<1 nm) is not always necessary [@thorpe2014retrieval,@jongaramrungruang2021remote, @cusworth2019potential], b) the humid tropics yield far less reliable retrievals than previously anticipated at km-scale resolutions, c) high spatial resolution provides attribution, enables direct ground-truthing of remote retrievals, and is the only way to obtain more cloud-free data in the humid tropics.

Carbon-I leverages the advances made by previous dedicated satellite missions such as SCIAMACHY [@frankenberg2005assessing], GOSAT, and OCO-2. In addition, we merge the advantages of high spatial resolution, which has now enabled revolutionary measurements of gas plumes, leading to actionable results [@thorpe2014retrieval]. Our retrieval and point flux inversion approach is based on many publication from Carbon-I team members, e.g. @jongaramrungruang2019towards, @jongaramrungruang2021remote, @jongaramrungruang2022methanet, @thompson2016aliso, @thompson2016space, @frankenberg2016airborne, @ayasse2018evaluating, @borchardt2020detection, @cusworth2019potential, @cusworth2021multisatellite, @cusworth2021quantifying, @duren2019california, @foote2020fast, @thorpe2014retrieval, @thorpe2016airborne, @thorpe2016mapping, @thorpe2017airborne, @thorpe2020methane, @thorpe2023attribution, @thorpe2023methane, @frankenberg2005assessing, @frankenberg2005iterative, @frankenberg2006satellite, @frankenberg2008pressure, @frankenberg2008tropical, @frankenberg2011global
