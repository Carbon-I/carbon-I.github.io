# The Carbon-I Testbed (CITB)
## NASA's ESE call

NASA's [Earth System Explorer](https://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/2023ESE/) call solicits Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations as recommended by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space. Greenhouse gases were specifically mentioned a high priority. Thus, we put a proposal into the ring again, following years of work on high-spatial resolution greenhouse gas mapping, a journey that started with initial AVIRIS-NG measurements, the first ever controlled release experiments using aircrafts, large-scale mapping of the anomalous CH<sub>4</sub> enhancements in the Four-Corners region, and now with the success of EMIT.

## Carbon-I
[Carbon-I](https://carbon-i.github.io/) is our response to NASA's ESE call, it can be considered a merger of the philosophies behind the original OCO mission and the high resolution mapping approaches that are now followed by EMIT, GHGSat, CarbonMapper, MethaneSat and others. We are eagerly awaiting a decision from NASA in April and are ready to hit the ground running. What could Carbon-I bring to the table? The combination of high spatial resolution and high enough spectral resolution for trace gas mapping solves two problems: 

I) We will obtain enough data in the tropics, which has been a major problem for OCO-2, TROPOMI and other missions, mostly because shallow cumulus clouds have cloud gaps that are much smaller than the footprint size of current greenhouse gas sensors. This leads to periods of **data drought** in the humid tropics [Pre-print paper](https://essopenarchive.org/users/528524/articles/717473-data-drought-in-the-humid-tropics-how-to-overcome-the-cloud-barrier-in-greenhouse-gas-remote-sensing):

II) It will avoid surface interferences, that plagues high-spatial-resolution mappers with coarse spectral resolution. 

We have a great team and are doing something **different** with Carbon-I. The greenhouse gas remote sensing field is getting crowded, both on the agency side targetting high accuracy for flux inversions (OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, GOSAT-2, GOSAT-GW, TROPOMI, Sentinel-5, CO2M, etc) as well as the plume mapping side to provide actionable results (EMIT, GHGSat, MethaneSat, CarbonMapper). Carbon-I aims to tackle the issue those missions can't resolve by merging their advantages...

## A Carbon-I website...
Why create a website for something that isn't even funded yet? Honestly, Quarto makes this a lot more fun and provides an ideal system for scientists to run their own website, and describe science in fun interactive ways. [Carbon-I](https://carbon-i.github.io/) is still very rudimentary but creating some interactive graphics with ObservableJS has been fun, even though I **dislike** java script syntax. So it has been absolutely worth it and we learned a lot along the way...
