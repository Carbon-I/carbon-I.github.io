Andre Butz is Professor of Atmospheric Physics at the Institute of Environmental Physics at Heidelberg University, Germany. He is a member of the Carbon-I Science Team.

Dr. Butz’ research centers on understanding the variability and trends in the gaseous composition of the atmosphere and how these relate to mechanistic changes in the Earth system. To this end, for more than 20 years, Dr. Butz has been developing next-generation spectroscopic instruments [@strandgren_towards_2020;@palmer_role_2022;low_portable_2023;schmitt_open-path_2023] and algorithms [@butz_toward_2011] that enable more precise and more granular insights [@jungmann_zooming-for_2022] into the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere with a particular focus on carbon dioxide and methane. Using these methods in remote sensing applications and collecting data from various platforms including satellites [@hu_toward_2018], balloons [@butz_observational_2007;@butz_constraints_2009] and ground-based carriers [@butz_versatile_2022,knapp_spectrometric_2023], Dr. Butz aims at deciphering the processes that drive the variability in the global carbon cycle [@metz_soil_2023] and in atmospheric photochemistry [@voss_novel_2024].
