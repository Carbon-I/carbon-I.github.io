## Global Mode

An especially effective device for enhancing the explanatory power of time-series displays is to add spatial dimensions to the design of the graphic,

Beginning at left on the Polish-Russian border near the Niemen River, the thick tan flow-line shows the size of the Grand Army (422,000) as it invaded Russia in June 1812. [@cr-global]

The width of this band indicates the size of the army at each place on the map.

In September, the army reached Moscow, which was by then sacked and deserted, with 100,000 men.[@cr-global]{pan-to="70%,-10%" scale-by="2.1"}

The path of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow is depicted by the darker, lower band, which is linked to a temperature scale and dates at the bottom of the chart. It was a bitterly cold winter, and many froze on the march out of Russia. @cr-map

As the graphic shows, the crossing of the Berezina River was a disaster, and the army finally struggled back into Poland with only 10,000 men remaining. @cr-map

It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.
