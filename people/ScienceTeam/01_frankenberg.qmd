Christian Frankenberg is Professor of Environmental Sciences & Engineering (ESE) at Caltech and works on the global carbon cycle. He is the Carbon-I Principal Investigator and responsible for the quality and direction of the investigation. 

Dr. Frankenberg has two decades of experience in remote sensing of atmospheric trace gases, in particular methane [@frankenberg2005assessing; @frankenberg2016airborne;@frankenberg2008tropical], carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Dr. Frankenbergâ€™s main research focus is the global carbon cycle and how to connect models with remote sensing data, both for the atmosphere as well as the surface [@frankenberg2011global;@frankenberg2012chlorophyll;@frankenberg2014orbiting; @frankenberg2014orbiting; @frankenberg2018chlorophyll; @hayashida2013methane;  @he2019atmospheric; @he2020ground; @he2023weekly; @houweling2014multi; @humphrey2021soil; @irakulis2021satellite; @jacob2022quantifying ]. He has developed the proxy method for accurate methane retrievals [@frankenberg2005assessing], improved methane spectroscopy [@frankenberg2008methane; @tran20102nu3] to minimize biases in satellite data, developed solar chlorophyll fluorescence retrievals from space [@frankenberg2011disentangling; @frankenberg2011global], wrote the IMAP pre-processor code for OCO-2/3, organized a [methane workshop](https://www.workshop.caltech.edu/methane/presentations.html) with global experts at Caltech and is currently leading the land surface model development in the Climate Modelling Alliance ([CliMA](https://www.workshop.caltech.edu/methane/presentations.html)). He also c0-organized the first airborne campaigns for controlled released experiments of methane [@thorpe2016mapping] as well as the first wide-area coverage investigation in the Four Corners area [@frankenberg2016airborne].
