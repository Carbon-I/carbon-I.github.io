    "text": "Carbon-I\n\nCarbon-I is our response to NASA’s ESE call, it can be considered a merger of the philosophies behind the original OCO mission and the high resolution mapping approaches that are now followed by EMIT, GHGSat, CarbonMapper, MethaneSat and others. We are eagerly awaiting a decision from NASA in April and are ready to hit the ground running. What could Carbon-I bring to the table? The combination of high spatial resolution and high enough spectral resolution for trace gas mapping solves two problems:\n\nWe will obtain enough data in the tropics, which has been a major problem for OCO-2, TROPOMI and other missions, mostly because shallow cumulus clouds have cloud gaps that are much smaller than the footprint size of current greenhouse gas sensors. This leads to periods of data drought in the humid tropics Pre-print paper: \nIt will avoid surface interferences, that plagues high-spatial-resolution mappers with coarse spectral resolution.\n\nWe have a great team and are doing something different with Carbon-I. The greenhouse gas remote sensing field is getting crowded, both on the agency side targetting high accuracy for flux inversions (OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, GOSAT-2, GOSAT-GW, TROPOMI, Sentinel-5, CO2M, etc) as well as the plume mapping side to provide actionable results (EMIT, GHGSat, MethaneSat, CarbonMapper). Carbon-I aims to tackle the issue those missions can’t resolve by merging their advantages…"

While we have a good understanding of anthropogenic sources of CO2 at national to continental scales, uncertainties surrounding CH4 are an order of magnitude higher, as sources range from agriculture and waste management to fossil fuel production and use (Turner, Frankenberg, and Kort 2019; Saunois et al. 2017). The recent acceleration in the methane growth rate creates an urgency to act, yet we do not even understand the relative contribu- tions of natural climate feedbacks (Zhang et al. 2023) and anthropogenic sources (Jackson et al. 2020)."

    "text": "Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have been achieved in retrieving GHG data from space-based platforms. Lessons learned from the past play a crucial role in shaping our requirements and approach. We now know that a) very high spectral resolution (&lt;1 nm) is not always necessary (Cusworth et al., 2019; Jongaramrungruang et al., 2021; A. Thorpe et al., 2014), b) the humid tropics yield far less reliable retrievals than previously anticipated at km-scale resolutions, c) high spatial resolution provides attribution, enables direct ground-truthing of remote retrievals, and is the only way to obtain more cloud-free data in the humid tropics. This list of papers is far from complete and will be updated in the near future.\nCarbon-I leverages the advances made by previous dedicated satellite missions such as SCIAMACHY (C. Frankenberg et al., 2005), GOSAT, and OCO-2. In addition, we merge the advantages of high spatial resolution, which has now enabled revolutionary measurements of gas plumes, leading to actionable results (A. Thorpe et al., 2014). Our retrieval and point flux inversion approach is based on many publication from Carbon-I team members, e.g. Jongaramrungruang et al. (2019), Jongaramrungruang et al. (2021), Jongaramrungruang et al. (2022), D. R. Thompson et al. (2016), D. Thompson et al. (2016), Christian Frankenberg et al. (2016), Ayasse et al. (2018), Borchardt et al. (2020), Cusworth et al.

To this end, for more than 20 years, Dr. Butz has been developing next-generation spectroscopic instruments [Strandgren et al. (2020);Palmer et al. (2022);low_portable_2023;schmitt_open-path_2023] and algorithms (A.

Using these methods in remote sensing applications and collecting data from various platforms including satellites (Hu et al. 2018), balloons (A. Butz et al. 2007, 2009) and ground-based carriers (André Butz et al. 2022,knapp_spectrometric_2023), Dr. Butz aims at deciphering the processes that drive the variability in the global carbon cycle (Metz et al. 2023) and in atmospheric photochemistry (Voss et al. 2024)."

    "text": "Suniti Sanghavi is a remote sensing scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with a focus on radiative transfer modeling and inversion algorithm development.\nDr. Sanghavi recognized the need for fast and accurate radiative transfer modeling while carrying out the first Optimal Estimation based inversion of aerosol properties using SCIAMACHY data (Suniti Sanghavi, Platt, and Landgraf 2010; S. Sanghavi et al. 2012). She later expanded her approach to MISR (Diner et al. 2012), leading to state-of-the-art refinements in aerosol electromagnetic scattering simulations (Suniti Sanghavi 2014; Suniti Sanghavi and Stephens 2015) and forward modeling (Suniti Sanghavi and Natraj 2013; S. V. Sanghavi et al. 2013; Suniti Sanghavi, Davis, and Eldering 2014). The resulting framework was used to carry out sensitivity studies and information content analyses of the influence of aerosol and cloud properties on OCO/GOSAT measurements (S. Sanghavi, Lebsock, and Stephens 2015; Suniti Sanghavi et al. 2020). The vSmartMOM modeling framework has also been applied to study the cloudy atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs (Suniti Sanghavi and Shporer 2018; Suniti Sanghavi and West 2019; Suniti Sanghavi, West, and Jiang 2021). Following the GPU adaptation of vSmartMOM (Jeyaram, Sanghavi, and Frankenberg 2022), Dr. Sanghavi’s work led to the development of a GPU accelerated inelastic scattering model (Suniti Sanghavi 2022; Suniti Sanghavi and Frankenberg 2023) that allows the correction of hyperspectral retrievals for biases caused by Raman scattering. Similar corrections due to the hyperspectral effects of canopy radiative transfer are being developed jointly with Dr. Frankenberg."

His work advances the theory and practice of imaging spectroscopy for remote sensing. David achieved the first detection of a facility-scale methane superemitter from orbit [@thompson2016aliso]. He is currently the Instrument Scientist for NASA’s EMIT imaging spectrometer mission, responsible for performance assessment, radiometric calibration, and spectral calibration. In this role, he also spearheaded a demonstration of the first active on-orbit FPA alignment, achieving positional adjustments with sub-micron precision [@thompson2024emit]. David pioneered the use of optimal estimation algorithms for atmosphere/surface estimation by broadband visible-shortwave imaging spectrometers [@thompson2018optimal], a technique which is now considered state of the art, and is used operationally by EMIT."
