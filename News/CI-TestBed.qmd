## The Carbon-I Testbed (CITB)

![](/img/citb_r2d2.jpg)

**The Carbon-I Test Bed (CITB)** is a high-resolution optomechanical imaging spectrometer built at JPL/Caltech as a rapid prototype and proof of concept for advanced atmospheric gas detection of **CH₄, CO₂, and CO**. Despite an aggressive development timeline—October to February—the team achieved first measurements by January 30, leveraging **additive manufacturing** for critical structural components.

## Key Features
1. **Optical System**  
   A Dyson lens, silicon-on-insulator slit, and a 3072×512 CHROMA-D detector work together to deliver **0.7 nm/pixel** resolution in the **2040–2380 nm** spectral range.

2. **Largest JPL Grating**  
   A **145 mm diameter** concave, blazed grating made of N-BK7 is the largest ever used at JPL, enabling precise dispersion over the entire SWIR band.

3. **3D Printed Structure**  
   The spectrometer housing, grating mount, and strut fittings—printed from **Al 6061** and **Ti 6Al‑4V**—represent the largest metal 3D-printed parts at JPL, ensuring rapid iteration and reduced fabrication time.

4. **Thermal Flexures**  
   Compliant flexures accommodate thermal mismatches under vacuum and cooling conditions, maintaining alignment for operational temperatures as low as **240 K** for the spectrometer and **155 K** for the detector.

## Development & Current Status
- **Record Build Time**  
  Final alignment and first light were reached in under a month, a pace enabled by heritage designs, in-house spare hardware, and deep technical expertise.

- **Present Work**  
  The CITB is under vacuum, cooling to **240 K** (spectrometer) and **155 K** (detector). Integration with PBIP (Polarization Beam Interference Platform) is ongoing to refine the instrument’s response function.

This **fast, precise, and scalable** spectrometer validates the feasibility of Dyson-based imaging spectrometers at high spectral resolution. For example results—including a CH₄ gas-cell spectrum measured under warm, pre-aligned conditions—see [this notebook](https://github.com/Carbon-I/CarbonI/blob/main/src/notebooks/TestBed.ipynb). Additional tests are planned, underscoring the CITB’s role as a **cornerstone** for next-generation space-based greenhouse gas monitoring.
