## The Carbon Investigation  
A mission selected by NASA for a Phase A concept study as an [Earth System Explorer](https://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/2023ESE/index.html).

### DISCLAIMER: **This is work in progress, no official website yet**

## High-resolution Mapping of Obscured Greenhouse Gases

### *Greenhouse gas studies from space are limited by scarce data in the cloudy tropics and by spatial resolution of current instruments*


## Carbon-I Will:

- #### Collect 1000 times more data in the tropics by observing between clouds
- #### Differentiate the sources and composition of emissions at the city block level anywhere
---

## Objectives

1. #### Identify, characterize and quantify hotspots of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions across the globe
2. #### Quantify global CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO monthly fluxes at unprecedented 12-100km resolution 
3. #### Attribute and quantify the processes driving natural and anthropogenic greenhouse gas fluxes

--- 

## Mission Overview

- #### Global mode: <400m sampling of land and coastal oceans monthly
- #### Target mode: <50m sampling of key regions (95kmx95km; over 2 million acres)
- #### Absorption spectroscopy to measure CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and relevant chemical tracers
