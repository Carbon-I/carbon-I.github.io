Bianca Baier is a physical scientist at the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado and PI of the NOAA AirCore Program. Her research interests include developing and deploying new in situ technologies, methods and platforms for observing greenhouse gases from the surface to the stratosphere. Her most recent work has focused on the development of a return glider technology for expanding AirCore near-total-column sampling in data poor, climate-critical areas such as the tropics.
