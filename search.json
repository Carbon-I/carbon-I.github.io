    "text": "Suniti Sanghavi is a remote sensing scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory with a focus on radiative transfer modeling and inversion algorithm development.\nDr.Â Sanghavi recognized the need for fast and accurate radiative transfer modeling while carrying out the first Optimal Estimation based inversion of aerosol properties using SCIAMACHY data (Suniti Sanghavi, Platt, and Landgraf 2010; S. Sanghavi et al. 2012). She later expanded her approach to MISR (Diner et al. 2012), leading to state-of-the-art refinements in aerosol electromagnetic scattering simulations (Suniti Sanghavi 2014; Suniti Sanghavi and Stephens 2015) and forward modeling (Suniti Sanghavi and Natraj 2013; S. V. Sanghavi et al. 2013; Suniti Sanghavi, Davis, and Eldering 2014). The resulting framework was used to carry out sensitivity studies and information content analyses of the influence of aerosol and cloud properties on OCO/GOSAT measurements (S. Sanghavi, Lebsock, and Stephens 2015; Suniti Sanghavi et al. 2020). The vSmartMOM modeling framework has also been applied to study the cloudy atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs (Suniti Sanghavi and Shporer 2018; Suniti Sanghavi and West 2019; Suniti Sanghavi, West, and Jiang 2021). Following the GPU adaptation of vSmartMOM (Jeyaram, Sanghavi, and Frankenberg 2022), Dr.Â Sanghaviâs work led to the development of a GPU accelerated inelastic scattering model (Suniti Sanghavi 2022; Suniti Sanghavi and Frankenberg 2023) that allows the correction of hyperspectral retrievals for biases caused by Raman scattering. Similar corrections due to the hyperspectral effects of canopy radiative transfer are being developed jointly with Dr.Â Frankenberg."

This enables global flux inversions while also allowing us to detect point sources (including the infamous unknown or know unknowns). Sampling the tropics is of particular importance as those regions are the achilles heel of current satellites.\n\n\n\n\nZooming in, it allows us to see even finer details and how a 300m resolution will allow us to observe the fine-structure of clouds.\n\n\n\n\nIn target mode, Carbon-I collects higher-resolution (&lt;50m) measurements over specific areas of interest. This approach is particularly useful for fine-scale analyses of emission hotspots, local sources, or dynamically changing ecosystems. By focusing on tighter grids, the mission can detect small-scale spatial variations and improve flux estimates in critical regions, complementing the broader but coarser observations from global mode.\n\n\n\n\nHere, we zoom into the Los Angeles Area â¦\n\n\n\n\nMore to follow"

    "text": "What is going on with methane?\nHuman activities have significantly altered the Earthâs carbon cycle and energy budget through the release of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). While we have a good understanding of anthropogenic sources of CO2 at national to continental scales, uncertainties surrounding CH4 are an order of magnitude higher, as sources range from agriculture and waste management to fossil fuel production and use (Turner, Frankenberg, and Kort 2019; Saunois et al. 2017). The recent acceleration in the methane growth rate creates an urgency to act, yet we do not even understand the relative contribu- tions of natural climate feedbacks (Zhang et al. 2023) and anthropogenic sources (Jackson et al. 2020)."

We are eagerly awaiting a decision from NASA in April and are ready to hit the ground running. What could Carbon-I bring to the table? The combination of high spatial resolution and high enough spectral resolution for trace gas mapping solves two problems:\n\nWe will obtain enough data in the tropics, which has been a major problem for OCO-2, TROPOMI and other missions, mostly because shallow cumulus clouds have cloud gaps that are much smaller than the footprint size of current greenhouse gas sensors. This leads to periods of data drought in the humid tropics Pre-print paper: \nIt will avoid surface interferences, that plagues high-spatial-resolution mappers with coarse spectral resolution.\n\nWe have a great team and are doing something different with Carbon-I. The greenhouse gas remote sensing field is getting crowded, both on the agency side targetting high accuracy for flux inversions (OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, GOSAT-2, GOSAT-GW, TROPOMI, Sentinel-5, CO2M, etc) as well as the plume mapping side to provide actionable results (EMIT, GHGSat, MethaneSat, CarbonMapper).

    "text": "Over the past two decades, remarkable advancements have been achieved in retrieving GHG data from space-based platforms. Lessons learned from the past play a crucial role in shaping our requirements and approach. We now know that a) very high spectral resolution (&lt;1 nm) is not always necessary (Cusworth et al., 2019; Jongaramrungruang et al., 2021; A. Thorpe et al., 2014), b) the humid tropics yield far less reliable retrievals than previously anticipated at km-scale resolutions, c) high spatial resolution provides attribution, enables direct ground-truthing of remote retrievals, and is the only way to obtain more cloud-free data in the humid tropics. This list of papers is far from complete and will be updated in the near future.\nCarbon-I leverages the advances made by previous dedicated satellite missions such as SCIAMACHY (C. Frankenberg et al., 2005), GOSAT, and OCO-2. In addition, we merge the advantages of high spatial resolution, which has now enabled revolutionary measurements of gas plumes, leading to actionable results (A. Thorpe et al., 2014). Our retrieval and point flux inversion approach is based on many publication from Carbon-I team members, e.g. Jongaramrungruang et al. (2019), Jongaramrungruang et al.

    "text": "Development & Current Status\n\nRecord Build Time\nInitial alignment (warm) and first light were reached in under a month, a pace enabled by heritage designs, in-house spare hardware, and deep technical expertise.\nPresent Work\nThe CITB is under vacuum, cooling to 240â¯K (spectrometer) and 155â¯K (detector). Integration with the PBIP (Penta Beam Injection Platform) is ongoing to refine the instrumentâs response function.\n\nThis fast, precise, and scalable spectrometer validates the feasibility of Dyson-based imaging spectrometers at high spectral resolution. For example resultsâincluding a CHâ gas-cell spectrum measured under warm conditions with initial alignmentâsee this notebook. Additional tests are planned, underscoring the CITBâs role as a cornerstone for next-generation space-based greenhouse gas monitoring and as a risk reduction exercise towards the space-borne version."
