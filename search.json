    "section": "LA Times article on Carbon-I efforts",
    "text": "LA Times article on Carbon-I efforts\nAAAS media fellow Noah Haggerty just published a nice article on our efforts to tackle greenhouse gases from airborne and satellite platforms, paving the way for the Carbon-I mission concept. The article can be found here. It nicely outlines our path from the Four Corners campaign to more routine observations of methane plumes. We have come a long way and have to go further still. Maybe we should follow up with a post here about the history of methane observations from space…\nTo quote the article and re-quote our Co-PI Anna Michalak:\nThe NASA program for which Carbon-I was selected as a finalist aims to fund space-based Earth science that will benefit society. The team was awarded $5 million to sharpen its project proposal before a final NASA review in 2025. There are three other finalists, and two will be selected for the launch.\nThis two-step process for selecting missions is new for NASA’s Earth science programs and requires JPL to compete with the rest of the scientific community, independent of their association with the space agency.\n“If we’re talking about grocery money, $5 million seems like a lot of money, but it’s really a bargain,” said Michalak. “If you think about the fact that you’re committing $300 million toward a mission, spending 1.5% of that to really make sure it’s going to be fabulous and successful is extremely smart.”\nIn the meantime, the Carbon-I team is focused on showing NASA that it has the technical know-how to execute the project on time and under budget.\n“I think all four of the missions in the current phase are absolutely worthwhile scientific missions,” said Michalak, “and 50% odds are not bad odds for a satellite mission.”"

Integration with the PBIP (Penta Beam Injection Platform) is ongoing to refine the instrument’s response function.\n\nThis fast, precise, and scalable spectrometer validates the feasibility of Dyson-based imaging spectrometers at high spectral resolution. For example results—including a CH₄ gas-cell spectrum measured under warm conditions with initial alignment—see this notebook. Additional tests are planned, underscoring the CITB’s role as a cornerstone for next-generation space-based greenhouse gas monitoring and as a risk reduction exercise towards the space-borne version."

This enables global flux inversions while also allowing us to detect point sources (including the infamous unknown or know unknowns). Sampling the tropics is of particular importance as those regions are the achilles heel of current satellites.\n\n\n\n\nZooming in, it allows us to see even finer details and how a 300m resolution will allow us to observe the fine-structure of clouds.\n\n\n\n\nIn target mode, Carbon-I collects higher-resolution (&lt;50m) measurements over specific areas of interest. This approach is particularly useful for fine-scale analyses of emission hotspots, local sources, or dynamically changing ecosystems. By focusing on tighter grids, the mission can detect small-scale spatial variations and improve flux estimates in critical regions, complementing the broader but coarser observations from global mode.\n\n\n\n\nHere, we zoom into the Los Angeles Area …\n\n\n\n\nMore to follow"

Thus, we put a proposal into the ring again, following years of work on high-spatial resolution greenhouse gas mapping, a journey that started with initial AVIRIS-NG measurements, the first ever controlled release experiments using aircrafts, large-scale mapping of the anomalous CH4 enhancements in the Four-Corners region, and now with the success of EMIT."

We are eagerly awaiting a decision from NASA in April and are ready to hit the ground running. What could Carbon-I bring to the table? The combination of high spatial resolution and high enough spectral resolution for trace gas mapping solves two problems:\n\nWe will obtain enough data in the tropics, which has been a major problem for OCO-2, TROPOMI and other missions, mostly because shallow cumulus clouds have cloud gaps that are much smaller than the footprint size of current greenhouse gas sensors. This leads to periods of data drought in the humid tropics Pre-print paper: \nIt will avoid surface interferences, that plagues high-spatial-resolution mappers with coarse spectral resolution.\n\nWe have a great team and are doing something different with Carbon-I. The greenhouse gas remote sensing field is getting crowded, both on the agency side targetting high accuracy for flux inversions (OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, GOSAT-2, GOSAT-GW, TROPOMI, Sentinel-5, CO2M, etc) as well as the plume mapping side to provide actionable results (EMIT, GHGSat, MethaneSat, CarbonMapper). Carbon-I aims to tackle the issue those missions can’t resolve by merging their advantages…"
