## NASA's ESE Concept Study selection

We received more than welcome [News](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/new-proposals-to-help-nasa-advance-knowledge-of-our-changing-climate/)! Our mission concept has been chosen by NASA to advance into a Phase A concept study as part of the [Earth System Explorer](https://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/2023ESE/) call. Congratulations also to the STRIVE, EDGE, and ODYSEA concepts. An intense year will be ahead of us to work on the Concept Study Report for Carbon-I, together with JPL as managing organization, Lockheed Martin as spacecraft provider and many scientists across various institutions.
