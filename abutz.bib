We report upper limits of IO and OIO in the tropical upper troposphere and stratosphere inferred from solar occultation spectra recorded by the LPMA/DOAS (Limb Profile Monitor of the Atmosphere/Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) payload during two stratospheric balloon flights from a station in Northern Brazil (5.1° S, 42.9° W). In the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, upper limits for both, IO and OIO, are below 0.1 ppt. Photochemical modelling is used to estimate the compatible upper limits for the total gaseous inorganic iodine burden (Iy) amounting to 0.09 to 0.16 (+0.10/−0.04) ppt in the tropical lower stratosphere (21.0 km to 16.5 km) and 0.17 to 0.35 (+0.20/−0.08) ppt in the tropical upper troposphere (16.5 km to 13.5 km). In the middle stratosphere, upper limits increase with altitude as sampling sensitivity decreases. Our findings imply that the amount of gaseous iodine transported into the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer is small. Thus, iodine-mediated ozone loss plays a minor role for contemporary stratospheric photochemistry but might become significant in the future if source gas emissions or injection efficiency into the upper atmosphere are enhanced. However, photochemical modelling uncertainties are large and iodine might be transported into the stratosphere in particulate form.},

            While the international community has made progress in adopting goals and agreements in the field of climate change mitigation, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are significantly lacking behind global ambitions for acceptable climate change. In this perspective, we discuss whether a window of opportunity for more effective climate action is emerging due to the convergence of new scientific and technological opportunities to provide high-resolution information on GHG emissions and emerging polycentric governance forms. We hypothesize that scientific and technological developments in the geophysical sciences and geoinformatics could provide the information policy makers need to put in place effective policies on climate change mitigation and to have measures to verify the effectiveness of their mitigation policies. To contribute to a better understanding of these developments and the requirements for effective climate action, new forms of inter- and transdisciplinary research become urgently necessary.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) requires the nations of the world to report their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The independent verification of these reported emissions is a cornerstone for advancing towards the emission accounting and reduction measures agreed upon in the Paris Agreement. In this paper, we present the concept and first performance assessment of a compact spaceborne imaging spectrometer with a spatial resolution of 50×50 m2 that could contribute to the “monitoring, verification and reporting” (MVR) of CO2 emissions worldwide. CO2 emissions from medium-sized power plants (1–10 Mt CO2 yr−1), currently not targeted by other spaceborne missions, represent a significant part of the global CO2 emission budget. In this paper we show that the proposed instrument concept is able to resolve emission plumes from such localized sources as a first step towards corresponding CO2 flux estimates. Through radiative transfer simulations, including a realistic instrument noise model and a global trial ensemble covering various geophysical scenarios, it is shown that an instrument noise error of 1.1 ppm (1σ) can be achieved for the retrieval of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2). Despite a limited amount of information from a single spectral window and a relatively coarse spectral resolution, scattering by atmospheric aerosol and cirrus can be partly accounted for in the XCO2 retrieval, with deviations of at most 4.0 ppm from the true abundance for two-thirds of the scenes in the global trial ensemble. We further simulate the ability of the proposed instrument concept to observe CO2 plumes from single power plants in an urban area using high-resolution CO2 emission and surface albedo data for the city of Indianapolis. Given the preliminary instrument design and the corresponding instrument noise error, emission plumes from point sources with an emission rate down to the order of 0.3 Mt CO2 yr−1 can be resolved, i.e., well below the target source strength of 1 Mt CO2 yr−1. This leaves a significant margin for additional error sources, like scattering particles and complex meteorology, and shows the potential for subsequent CO2 flux estimates with the proposed instrument concept.},

            The tropics is the nexus for many of the remaining gaps in our knowledge of environmental science, including the carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry, with dire consequences for our ability to describe the Earth system response to a warming world. Difficulties associated with accessibility, coordinated funding models and economic instabilities preclude the establishment of a dense pan-tropical ground-based atmospheric measurement network that would otherwise help to describe the evolving state of tropical ecosystems and the associated biosphere-atmosphere fluxes on decadal timescales. The growing number of relevant sensors aboard sun-synchronous polar orbiters provide invaluable information over the remote tropics, but a large fraction of the data collected along their orbits is from higher latitudes. The International Space Station (ISS), which is in a low-inclination, precessing orbit, has already demonstrated value as a proving ground for Earth observing atmospheric sensors and as a testbed for new technology. Because low-inclination orbits spend more time collecting data over the tropics, we argue that the ISS and its successors, offer key opportunities to host new Earth-observing atmospheric sensors that can lead to a step change in our understanding of tropical carbon fluxes.},

	abstract = {The Australian continent contributes substantially to the year-to-year variability of the global terrestrial carbon dioxide (CO2) sink. However, the scarcity of in situ observations in remote areas prevents the deciphering of processes that force the CO2 flux variability. In this study, by examining atmospheric CO2 measurements from satellites in the period 2009–2018, we find recurrent end-of-dry-season CO2 pulses over the Australian continent. These pulses largely control the year-to-year variability of Australia’s CO2 balance. They cause two to three times larger seasonal variations compared with previous top-down inversions and bottom-up estimates. The pulses occur shortly after the onset of rainfall and are driven by enhanced soil respiration preceding photosynthetic uptake in Australia’s semiarid regions. The suggested continental-scale relevance of soil-rewetting processes has substantial implications for our understanding and modeling of global climate–carbon cycle feedbacks. Semi-arid regions cause much of the interannual variability in global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration because of seasonal fluctuations in water availability. Metz et al. found that recurrent carbon dioxide pulses occur at the end of the dry season over Australia, an effect that they attribute to enhanced soil respiration preceding photosynthetic uptake in semi-arid regions. The magnitudes of these pulses are two to three times larger than previous studies have inferred based on in situ measurements. —HJS The rewetting of seasonally dry soils produces large carbon dioxide pulses over Australia.},

Mapping the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) above source regions such as urban areas can deliver insights into the distribution and dynamics of local emission patterns. Here, we present the prototype development and an initial performance evaluation of a portable spectrometer that allows for measuring CO2 and CH4 concentrations integrated along a long ({\textgreater}10 km) horizontal path component through the atmospheric boundary layer above a target region. To this end, the spectrometer is positioned at an elevated site from which it points downward at reflection targets in the region, collecting the reflected sunlight at shallow viewing angles. The path-integrated CO2 and CH4 concentrations are inferred from the absorption fingerprint in the shortwave–infrared (SWIR) spectral range. While mimicking the concept of the stationary California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing – Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS) in Los Angeles, our portable setup requires minimal infrastructure and is straightforward to duplicate and to operate in various locations. For performance evaluation, we deployed the instrument, termed EM27/SCA, side by side with the CLARS-FTS at the Mt. Wilson Observatory (1670 m a.s.l.) above Los Angeles for a 1-month period in April/May 2022. We determined the relative precision of the retrieved slant column densities (SCDs) for urban reflection targets to be 0.36 \%–0.55 \% for O2, CO2 and CH4, where O2 is relevant for light path estimation. For the partial vertical column (VCD) below instrument level, which is the quantity carrying emission information, the propagated precision errors amount to 0.75 \%–2 \% for the three gases depending on the distance to the reflection target and solar zenith angle. The comparison to simultaneous CLARS-FTS measurements shows good consistency, but the observed diurnal patterns highlight the need to take light scattering into account to enable detection of emission patterns.},

Monitoring the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) is a key ingredient for fostering our understanding of the mechanisms behind the sources and sinks of these gases and for verifying and quantitatively attributing their anthropogenic emissions. Here, we present the instrumental setup and performance evaluation of an open-path GHG observatory in the city of Heidelberg, Germany. The observatory measures path-averaged concentrations of CO2 and CH4 along a 1.55 km path in the urban boundary layer above the city. We combine these open-path data with local in situ measurements to evaluate the representativeness of these observation types on the kilometer scale. This representativeness is necessary to accurately quantify emissions, since atmospheric models tasked with this job typically operate on kilometer-scale horizontal grids. For the operational period between 8 February and 11 July 2023, we find a precision of 2.7 ppm (0.58 \%) and 18 ppb (0.89 \%) for the dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (xCO2) and CH4 (xCH4) in 5 min measurements, respectively. After bias correction, the open-path measurements show excellent agreement with the local in situ data under atmospheric background conditions. Both datasets show clear signals of traffic CO2 emissions in the diurnal xCO2 cycle. However, there are particular situations, such as under southeasterly wind conditions, in which the in situ and open-path data reveal distinct differences up to 20 ppm in xCO2, most likely related to their different sensitivity to local emission and transport patterns. Our setup is based on a Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier transform spectrometer, which offers a spacious and modular design providing ample opportunities for future refinements of the technique with respect to finer spectral resolution and wider spectral coverage to provide information on gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.},
